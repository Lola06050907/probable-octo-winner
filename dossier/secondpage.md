Dom created his own festival called Bludfest for the very first time this year. It took place in August in Milton Keynes Bowl, more specifically in Buckinghamshire, in England. He wanted the prices of tickets to be as low as possible because a lot of people can't afford to pay for festival tickets because they are usually very expensive. He said music is for everybody so he wanted as many people as possible to be able to get tickets. (The tickets were Â£49.50 and there were more than 7 artists who played at the festival, including Lola Young, Noahfinnce, The Damned (this band was the icon slot of the event), Jasmin Bean and Lil Yatchy. 

There were other things to do there as well: there were places where you could buy merchandise or even designer clothes from the brand he created called BRAT (which stands for Beautifullly Romanticised Accidentally Traumatised). There were different types of food to choose from 
(You could eat at Nando's and get a Yungblud's burger :) or even drink Bludbeer!) 
There was also pub that was built on the premises. It was the Hawley Arms (the pub in Camben Town, in London).

There was also a make a friend tent, which was great if you needed a place to chill and unwind. It was also a place to make friends if you were worried about going to Bludfest on your own. (There was also a little garden behind the tent where you could relax too, that's where, my friend and I made some friends with other fans). 

There was also a "Yungblud exhibition" where you could see different items from when Dom was on tour (like his guitar) or his previous albums. Plus, at the end of the exhibition, you could write a secret or a confessions on the walls. Then, you can get a free pin (with a little ghost on it -the ghost is playing guitar-). You could also buy the book he wrote called "you need to exist" and get a free bookmark!). More info about the book via this link:
