## Biography 
### Basics
Dominic Richard Harrison (stagename Yungblud) is an English artist (more specifically a singer and a songwriter). He was born on the 5th of August 1997, in Doncaster, which is a city in the North of England, more specificallly in South Yorkshire.  

His songs don't really fit a box in terms of music genres. He released different types of songs that could be labelled as pop, rock, hip hop or punk songs. His work is inspired from different singers and bands. For example, he gets his inspiration from My Chemical Romance, the Clash, the Cure, the Sex Pistols, Lady Gaga or even Eminem.
His music gathered so many people together, his work enabled people to find a community where they can be themselves without judgment. This community is called the BHC (the black hearts club).

He was diagnosed with ADHD from a young age. It stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. He explained in an interview with Louis Theroux that it is a source of energy and that it was why he hasn't slept well enough in years. He also explained that at school, he had difficulties concentrating on certain tasks. He also had mood swings, which were elements that led to him getting his diagnosis. He addressed this topic in more details in an extract from the said interview, accessible via the following link: [Interview with Louis Theroux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_imPDsxfw).  

He moved to London when he was about 16, 17 years old. He was hoping that he would "find himself" there because gowing up in Doncaster, he was judged and mocked for the was he expressed himself, for being opinionated, outspoken  and for the way he was dressed. During his time in London, he was studying at the Art Educational School. At some point, he was sharing a flat with, his best friend, and now guitar player, Adam. They dicussed different anecdotes about that period of time in a podcast he made, called "The YUNGBLUD Podcast", accessible via this link: [The YUNGBLUD Podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000p82j).
