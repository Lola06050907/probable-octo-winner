## Biography 
### Basics
Dominic Richard Harrison (stagename Yungblud) is an English artist (more specifically a singer and a songwriter). He was born in Doncaster, which is a city located in the North of England, more specificallly in South Yorkshire. 
He was born on the 5th of August 1997. 
His songs don't really fit a box in terms of music genres. He released different types of songs that could be labelled as pop, rock, hip hop or punk songs. His work is inspried from different singers that make different types of songs. For example, he got his inspiration from My Chemical Romance, the Clash, the Cure, the Sex Pistols, Lady Gaga or even Eminem.
His music gathered so many people together, his work enabled people to find a community where they can be themselves without judgment, which is called the BHC (the black hearts club). 

#### His family/childhood
His mum (Samantha Harrison) own a café and his dad (Justin Harrison) own a record shop. He has two younger sisters (named Isobel and Jemima). 
He was diagnosed with ADHD from a very young age. It stands for Attention Hyperactivity Deficit Disorder. He explained in an interview with Louis Theroux that it was a source of energy and that it was why he hadn't slept well enough in years. He also explained that at school, he had difficulties concentrating on any task. He also had mood swings which were elemments that led to him getting his diagnosis. He addressed this topic in more details in an extract from the said interview, accessible via the following link: [The interview with Louis Theroux]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG_imPDsxfw). 

He moved to London when he was about 16, 17 years old. He was hoping that he would "find himself" there because gowing up in Doncaster, he explained that he was judged and mocked for the was he expressed himself, for being opinionated, outspoken  and for the was he dressed. During his time in London, he was studying at the Art Educational School. At some point, he was sharing a flat with, his best friend, and now guitar player, Adam .... They dicussed different anecdotes about that period of time in a podcast he made called "The YUNGBLUD Podcast", accessible via this link for more info: [The YUNGBLUD Podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m000p82j).

Dom created his own festival called Bludfest for the very first time this year. It took place in August in Milton Keynes Bowl, more specifically in Buckinghamshire, in England. He wanted the prices of tickets to be as low as possible because a lot of people can't afford to pay for festival tickets because they are usually very expensive. He said music is for everybody so he wanted as many people as possible to be able to get tickets. (The tickets were £49.50 and there were more than 7 artists who played at the festival, including Lola Young, Noahfinnce, The Damned (this band was the icon slot of the event), Jasmin Bean and Lil Yatchy. 

There were other things to do there as well: there were places where you could buy merchandise or even designer clothes from the brand he created called BRAT (which stands for Beautifullly Romanticised Accidentally Traumatised). There were different types of food to choose from 
(You could eat at Nando's and get a Yungblud's burger :) or even drink Bludbeer!) 
There was also pub that was built on the premises. It was the Hawley Arms (the pub in Camben Town, in London).

There was also a make a friend tent, which was great if you needed a place to chill and unwind. It was also a place to make friends if you were worried about going to Bludfest on your own. (There was also a little garden behind the tent where you could relax too, that's where, my friend and I made some friends with other fans). 

There was also a "Yungblud exhibition" where you could see different items from when Dom was on tour (like his guitar) or his previous albums. Plus, at the end of the exhibition, you could write a secret or a confessions on the walls. Then, you can get a free pin (with a little ghost on it -the ghost is playing guitar-). You could also buy the book he wrote called "you need to exist" and get a free bookmark!). More info about the book via this link:
